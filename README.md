So far we do not know the tax implications of Cryptocurrnecy.  We aim to assist with the liability by becoming a 501c3 tax deductible charitable organization.  Your support will pay forward as we are able to be a support to the world when the people are in crisis.  
We must do our part to ensure the future is ready without us.  It is our goal to make sure we educate those on maintaining clean rivers and water sources, provide food and seeds and teach sustainable gardening for small spaces.  It is our job to preserve the Human Species at all cost.  We aim to do our part.  
We hope to also bring financial support to all cryptocurrency holders worried about regulation and how their holdings can place them in massive debt.  We will only be able to offer a tax deduction receipts to businesses and individuals in the United States at this time. 
We are volunteer ran and the founder is recovering from a medical injury so we are not great on time lines and all of our projects are developed from whitepapers as we believe in supporting various developers in their endeavors.  


FUTURE OUTLOOK
We have a wallet and separate Blockchain yet we need a full time dev team to implement.  We are a few years away. It will be a pre-mine and the pre-mined coins will remain locked and the key will be burned as to never be released or sold. We will hold a burning ceromony once the first block has been mined - development and release will be in approx. 5 years.    



Thank you for your patience and support.
